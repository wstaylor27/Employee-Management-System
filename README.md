  ## Description:
  This repo involved creating a employee database. I must include employee id, first name, last name, role, department, salary and the employee's manager. I must be able to view employees, roles, and department. I must also be able to add employees, roles, departments and be able to update the employee's information if it were to change.
  
  ## Installation:
  The developer must install mysql2, console.table and inquirer packages prior running the index.js in the terminal.
  
  ## Usage:
  This application is used to store tasks and delete them when no longer necessary.
  
  ## License:
  ISC
  
  ## Contribution:
  If anyone is interested in contributing, please notify me via GitHub
  
  ## Testing:
  I used the terminal in VS Code to test my code. I also used console.log for callbacks to view what was being passed.
  
  ## Lessons Learned:
  When I first started this project, I realized I didn't need to create routes. I could manage all the information by using inquirer.
